	port -- The port on which the peer's server socket runs
	Socket -- defaults to None, but can (and should) be added for the socket of the peer
	name -- initialized as None, but can be added to give a peer a human-readable name

	For purposes of connecting to new peers who are known only by server port and ip,
	id is initialized to None. A Peer's id should generally not change except from None.
